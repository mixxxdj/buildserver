 - Functions chromaprint_encode_fingerprint and chromaprint_decode_fingerprint
   are changed to accept const pointer as input
 - Added support for using the Kiss FFT library (should make Android port easier)
 - Removed obsolete dev tools from the package
 - More compatible DEBUG() macro

Version 1.1 -- November 23, 2013
================================

 - Fixed potential DoS attack in fingerprint decompression code. (#6)

   CHROMAPRINT_ALGORITHM_TEST4.

Version 0.6 -- December 22, 2011
================================

 - Support for 24-bit file formats in fpcalc.
 - The fpcalc utility now uses 120 seconds of audio data by default.
 - Python bindings moved to a separate project (pyacoustid).

Version 0.5 -- October 6, 2011
==============================

 - Unicode command line handling in fpcalc.
